A fun, lightweight Python GUI application created with **Tkinter**. This app asks a simple question: *"Do You Like Me?"* There's a catch: **The user literally cannot click "No".** The "No" button dodges the mouse cursor whenever the user tries to click it, leaving "Yes" as the only option!

## ✨ Features

* **Interactive Gameplay:** The "No" button teleports to a random location within the safe bounds of the window when hovered over.
* **Modern "NiceUI" Theme:** Uses a custom Dark Blue-Grey and Emerald Green color palette rather than default system colors.
* **Borderless Window:** Utilizes `overrideredirect(True)` for a sleek, floating-card look.
* **Smart Centering:** Automatically calculates screen dimensions to center the popup on any monitor.
* **Success Feedback:** Displays a heart-warming message box when "Yes" is clicked.
