A modern, sleek implementation of the "Unrejectable Proposal" prank using **NiceGUI**. This version leverages web technologies and Tailwind CSS to create a beautiful, responsive UI that runs as a standalone desktop application.

* **Modern Styling:** 
* **Animations:** 
* **Smooth Transitions:**

## ✨ Features

* **Native Mode:** Runs as a clean desktop window (no browser address bar) using `native=True`.
* **Evasive Button:** The "No" button detects mouse hovering and moves to a random percentage-based position on the card.
* **Reactive UI:** Upon clicking "Yes", the entire card clears instantly and updates with a celebration screen without opening new windows.
* **Notification System:** Uses built-in toast notifications for feedback.
